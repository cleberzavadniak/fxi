# fxi

A kind of a "X11" command line applications building framework

Partly inspired by VisiData, partly from my own hatred for most of modern
in-browser applications, `fxi` has as its goal to facilitate to the
maximum building applications that you can interact with using your
keyboard and nothing more.

Actually, I don't want to open a web browser to check my e-mails, but
I don't want to read them at a white-in-black terminal screen, either.
I don't want to use AWS web console to check the state of SQS queues, but
I don't think awscli is too much of a better option. I want to read some
news and I want to see images.

`fxi` is going to help me with all that.
